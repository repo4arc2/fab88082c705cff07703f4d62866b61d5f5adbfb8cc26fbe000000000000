My wife and her flying saucers.

My husband and his indestructible head.

00:00:12,137 --> 00:00:14,890
Hello, dear.
I'm Agnes, your neighbor to the right.

Yes, dear?

22
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:43,812
Only your lovely rose bushes.

That's all?

24
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:48,233
Are you using your night vision, Vision?

25
00:01:48,317 --> 00:01:50,485
I assure you, my love,
I see nothing amiss.

You have absolutely
no reason to be frightened... (YELPS)

You were saying?

28
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:01,788
Actually, I did overhear
a couple of lads at work

29
00:02:01,872 --> 00:02:04,958
remarking on a few unsavory characters
settling in the neighborhood.

30
00:02:05,042 --> 00:02:08,003
Now, who knows
what those ne'er-do-wells might be up to?

31
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:10,255
Robbing houses, vandalizing property.

32
00:02:10,339 --> 00:02:13,008
Walking through walls,
moving objects without touching them.

33
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:16,637
Wanda, darling, you can't be suggesting
my colleagues were referring to us.

00:02:23,727 --> 00:02:26,480

Yes, I must say
I'm rather proud of myself.

44
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:47,543
And look how you seized
on the opportunity to redecorate.

45
00:02:47,626 --> 00:02:50,212
-This is better, isn't it?
-Mmm.

46

Say, those pants are peachy keen.

161
00:10:21,205 --> 00:10:22,748
Do you really think so?

162
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:25,083
The other ladies are in skirts.
I was worried.

163
00:10:25,167 --> 00:10:27,169
We only have a few hours until show time,

164
00:10:27,252 --> 00:10:30,422
so a little less cross chatter
and a little more focus.

165
00:10:31,173 --> 00:10:32,424
Okay.

166
00:10:32,508 --> 00:10:35,469
DOTTIE: Those little boys and girls
are counting on us.

167
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:38,347
All of this is for the children.

(CLEARS THROAT)

171
00:10:45,771 --> 00:10:49,816
So, I want you all
to give yourselves a big hand...

172
00:10:52,528 --> 00:10:55,447
...at the appropriate time, of course.

173
00:10:55,531 --> 00:10:58,992
But first let's review event etiquette.

174
00:10:59,076 --> 00:11:01,954
Dress code is upscale garden party...

175
00:11:02,037 --> 00:11:05,123
The only reason I didn't clap
is because I'm afraid to move.

176
00:11:05,207 --> 00:11:06,291
Yeah.

177
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,627
I actually don't know what I'm doing here.

178
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:11,922
I'm starting to feel that way myself.
I'm Wanda.

179
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:16,260
-I'm, uh... Geraldine.
-Hi.

180
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:18,303
And I'm irritated.

181
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:24,101
Tickets for tonight
are completely sold out.

182
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:26,019
Now, you can clap.

183
00:11:27,771 --> 00:11:29,273
And stop.

184
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:33,360
Really, how is anybody doing this sober?

185
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:45,247
-Let's say green.
-NORM: Yeah.

186
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:47,082
I mean, the other side could be dirt.

187
00:11:47,165 --> 00:11:49,877
Pardon me.
Is this the neighborhood watch meeting?

188
00:11:50,961 --> 00:11:53,422
NORM: Oh, hiya, Vision.

189
00:11:53,505 --> 00:11:55,549
Didn't expect to see you here.

190
00:11:56,842 --> 00:12:00,762
This is sort of
a "members only" type deal.

191
00:12:00,846 --> 00:12:03,640
Ah! Certainly. Right. Well...

192
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:06,852
I'll just stay here
and be as quiet as a church mouse

193
00:12:06,935 --> 00:12:09,062
till you open up the floor
for new business.

194
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:12,149
Well, in truth,
we were just getting to new business.

195
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:15,194
Oh, splendid! Could you tell me
how often you rotate security patrols?

196
00:12:15,277 --> 00:12:17,696
Do you interface directly
with local law enforcement?

197
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:20,032
What are your protocols for threats
such as burglary,

198
00:12:20,115 --> 00:12:21,450
graffiti, and reckless driving?

199
00:12:21,533 --> 00:12:24,536
-No, Vision.
-I know these are indeed grave matters.

200
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:27,998
"New business"
actually means another round of Danish.

201
00:12:28,749 --> 00:12:31,543
Raspberry or cheese-filled?

202
00:12:31,627 --> 00:12:33,962
Oh, neither for me, thank you.
I don't eat food.

203
00:12:40,052 --> 00:12:44,223
What I mean to say is that I don't eat
food in between meals but at mealtimes.

204
00:12:44,848 --> 00:12:46,892
I'm a regular eating machine.

he built for his kids?

He doesn't eat food.

228

Is gum food?

229
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,548
Well, my understanding
is that it's purely for mastication.

230
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:01,967
No, I don't do that.
